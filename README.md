- What is ServiceNow?
 a cloud computing platform to help companies manage digital workflows for enterprise operations.
ServiceNow is a cloud-based IT Service Management (ITSM) platform that enables the automation of IT business management. It is built in accordance with ITIL criteria to ensure that tasks, operations, and workflows are service-oriented. It leverages machine learning to accelerate and scale enterprises by using data and workflows.

- What is the business model / how do you pay for the service?

- What is IT service management (ITSM)?
3.	What is IT service management (ITSM)? IT Service Management – 
ITSM is a process based practice intended to align the delivery of Information Technology (IT) services with needs of the organization, emphasizing benefits to customers.
IT service management (ITSM) refers to the entirety of activities –
 directed by policies, 
organized and structured in processes and supporting procedures
 – that are performed by an organization to design, plan, deliver, operate and control information technology (IT) services offered to customers.
It is thus concerned with the implementation of IT services that meet customers' needs, and it is performed by the IT service provider through an appropriate mix of people, process and information technology.
IT Service Management Objectives
To align IT Services with the current and future needs of the business and its customers
To improve the quality of the IT services delivered
To reduce the long term cost of service provision

4.	What is cloud computing?
cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change.

5.	Advantages of cloud computing?
Cloud computing is a big shift from the traditional way businesses think about IT resources. Here are seven common reasons organizations are turning to cloud computing services:
Cost
Cloud computing eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware and software and setting up and running on-site datacenters—the racks of servers, the round-the-clock electricity for power and cooling, and the IT experts for managing the infrastructure. It adds up fast.
Speed
Most cloud computing services are provided self service and on demand, so even vast amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes, typically with just a few mouse clicks, giving businesses a lot of flexibility and taking the pressure off capacity planning.
Global scale
The benefits of cloud computing services include the ability to scale elastically. In cloud speak, that means delivering the right amount of IT resources—for example, more or less computing power, storage, bandwidth—right when they’re needed, and from the right geographic location.
Productivity
On-site datacenters typically require a lot of “racking and stacking”—hardware setup, software patching, and other time-consuming IT management chores. Cloud computing removes the need for many of these tasks, so IT teams can spend time on achieving more important business goals.
Performance
The biggest cloud computing services run on a worldwide network of secure datacenters, which are regularly upgraded to the latest generation of fast and efficient computing hardware. This offers several benefits over a single corporate datacenter, including reduced network latency for applications and greater economies of scale.
Reliability
Cloud computing makes data backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity easier and less expensive because data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on the cloud provider’s network.
Security
Many cloud providers offer a broad set of policies, technologies, and controls that strengthen your security posture overall, helping protect your data, apps, and infrastructure from potential threats.

6.	What is SaaS?
Software as a service is a method for delivering software applications over the Internet, on demand and typically on a subscription basis. With SaaS, cloud providers host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure, and handle any maintenance, like software upgrades and security patching. Users connect to the application over the Internet, usually with a web browser on their phone, tablet, or PC.
7.	 IaaS?
This is the most basic category of cloud computing services. With IaaS, you rent IT infrastructure—servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, and operating systems—from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.
8.	 PaaS?
Platform as a service refers to cloud computing services that supply an on-demand environment for developing, testing, delivering, and managing software applications. PaaS is designed to make it easier for developers to quickly create web or mobile apps, without worrying about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, network, and databases needed for development.

9.	What is ITIL?
acronym for Information Technology Infrastructure Library) is a 
set of detailed practices for 
IT service management (ITSM) that
 focuses on aligning IT services with the needs of business.

10.	What is incident management?
•	Deals with unplanned interruptions to IT Services or reductions in their quality
•	Failure of a configuration item that has not impacted a service is also an incident (e.g. Disk in RAID failure)
•	Reported by:
–	Users
–	Technical Staff
–	Monitoring Tools

Service Operation
–	Problem & Incident management
–	Request fulfilment
–	Event & Access management

11.	Problem mgmt?
Problem Management
•	Aims to prevent problems and resulting incidents
•	Minimises impact of unavoidable incidents
•	Eliminates recurring incidents
•	Proactive Problem Management
•	Identifies areas of potential weakness
•	Identifies workarounds
•	Reactive Problem Management
•	Indentifies underlying causes of incidents
•	Identifies changes to prevent recurrence

12.	Change mgmt?
Change Management helps organizations understand and work to minimize risks of changes to the IT environment. It is essentially a process for managing the people-side of change. 
ServiceNow helps implement your Change Management process by providing on-demand capabilities for creating, assessing, approving and implementing changes to your environment. 
Within the platform, changes are handled using the task record system. Each change is generated through a variety of means as a task record, populated with the pertinent information in individual fields. These tasks can be assigned to appropriate change management team members, who will deal with the task as appropriate. Once the change has been properly implemented, it is closed.

13.	Asset mgmt?
What is an Asset: 
An asset is an item, entity, or thing (tangible or intangible) that holds value for a Company or a person. 
Examples of Assets are Estates, Resources, Inventory, Equipment and Valuables. 
Note: All CI’s is not an asset, but all Asset’s is a CI. 

Asset Management System: 
It is an accounting process that seeks to track fixed assets for the purpose of financial accounting, preventive maintenance and avoid thefts. 
Organizations faces a significant challenge to track the 
1.	location, 
2.	quantity, 
3.	condition,
4.	maintenance, and 
5.	depreciation status
 of their fixed assets 
AMS gives the best way to manage the physical movement of asset like how many assets are there in the store, how many assets are assigned to employee and where the asset is lying physically with the help of bar code scanning. 

Asset Management vs CMDB 
Note: Asset Management and Configuration Management Database are related to each other but have different goals. 
- Asset management focuses on the financial tracking of the company property. 
- Configuration Management focused on building and maintaining elements that creates an available network of services. 


14.	Release mgmt?
Release Management encompasses the planning, design, build, configuration and testing of hardware and software releases to create a defined set of release components.


15.	What are Application & modules?
Application is a group of modules that provides related information. For example, a change application provides information related to the change process. It consists of modules like create change tickets, view change tickets, etc.

What is an ‘Application’ in ServiceNow?
Applications in ServiceNow represent packaged solutions for delivering services and managing business processes. 
In simple words it is a group of modules which provides information related to those modules. For example Incident application will provide information related to Incident Management process.

16.	How do you enable/disable an application in SNOW?

How to enable or disable an application?
Navigate to the “Application Menus” module under the system definition application. Open the respective application that requires enabling or disable. Set active as true to enable it or set active to false to disable it

- What are workflows?
Workflow is a virtual representation of tasks consisting of connected steps planned out in a sequential manner.
The Graphical Workflow engine automates multi-step processes. Each workflow has a sequence of activities, such as generating records or running scripts, and transitions between them based on conditions.
The workflow starts when a triggering event occurs. Common triggers include a record being inserted into a specific table, or a particular field in a table being set to a specified value. For example, you might
create a workflow that runs whenever a user requests approval for an item they want to order from the catalog. 

-   How do you troubleshoot a workflow?
Troubleshooting tools for workflows enable administrators to isolate execution paths, compare contexts, and track incomplete activities.
The workflow timeline provides a visual representation of the workflow, including transitions and the elapsed time for each activity. A troubleshooting tool for highlighting execution paths helps users perform forensics on a workflow. The highlighting feature can group multiple execution paths in various colors and can isolate rollback processing. Use the workflow highlighter to isolate incomplete tasks and approvals. You can also enable a workflow performance timing feature to troubleshoot slow workflows.

- How to setup notifications (SMS, email, etc)?
Email Notification Task
For email messages, an administrator writes a simple form email that is sent out every time a certain event occurs. For example, an email notification generated by an incident can contain information about who opened the incident, the incident's priority, and the description.
Users can enable or disable the email notifications for themselves. They can also define more specific rules regarding which email notifications to receive if subscription based notifications are active. Users who receive email notifications can respond to the email, which triggers an inbound email action. Inbound email actions are the other half of the communication functionality that email notifications provide. By responding to email notifications, users can interact with the system through their email provider, without logging in to the instance.
This follows the below 5 tasks approach
	 Configure Email Properties
	 Create Events and Business Rules
	 Create Email Notifications
	 Configure Email Addresses and Subscribe to Notifications
	 Create or Update ServiceNow Records via Email


- What are events / event registry?
 An Event is an indication to the ServiceNow processes that something notable has occurred.
 Events are caused by
   
	User actions
•	Logging in, approving a request, renaming an attachment
	Scripts
•	Business Rules, Workflows                              

Events are special records the system uses to log when certain conditions occur and to take some kind of action in response to the conditions.
The system uses business rules to monitor for system conditions and to generate event records in the Event [sysevent] table, which is also known as the event log or event queue.

Event registry
The events registry lists the events the system recognizes.
 Use registered events to automate other activities, such as script actions 


- What are event logs / debug events?

The System Logs module provides a variety of logs that you can use to troubleshoot and debug transactions and events that take place within the instance.


- What is CMDB (config mgmt database)?
The Configuration Management data base (CMDB) creates and maintains the logical configurations your network infrastructure needs to support a ServiceNow service.
These logical service configurations are mapped to the physical layout data of the supporting network and application infrastructure in each of your respective domains. They track the physical and logical state of IT service elements and associate incidents to the state of service elements, which helps in analyzing trends and reducing problems and incidents.
The configurations are stored in a configuration management database (ServiceNow CMDB) which consists of entities, called Configuration Items (CI), that are part of your environment. A CI may be:
•	A physical entity, such as a computer or router
•	A logical entity, such as an instance of a database
•	Conceptual, such as a Requisition Service


- What is CMDB baseline?
CMDB baselines help to understand and control the changes that have been made to a configuration item(CI) after its Baseline has been created. The baseline is the snapshot of a CI

- How does Asset and CI's are linked to each other?
Asset and configuration item (CI) management refers to creating assets, setting appropriate states and substates, synchronizing assets and CIs, managing consumables, and retiring assets.

- What is Business Service Map in CMDB?
Business Service Map in CMDB?
BSM Map is a Business Service Management map. 
It graphically displays the Configuration Items (CI). These items support a business service and indicates the status of those Configuration Items.

- What is a record?
Row in a table

- What is Record Producer?
A record producer is a type of catalogue item that allows users to create task-based records from the service catalog. For example, you can create a change record or problem record using a record producer. Record producers provide an alternative way to create records through the service catalogue

- How do you upload multiple records?
An import set is a tool that imports data from various data sources and, then maps that data into ServiceNow tables using transform map. It acts as a staging table for records imported.
 What is transform Map?
ServiceNow - A transform map is a set of field maps that determine the relationships between fields in an import set and fields in an existing ServiceNow table

A transform map transforms the record imported into ServiceNow import set table to the target table. It also determines the relationships between fields displaying in an Import Set table and fields in a target table.

Load, transform map, transform

- What is data lookup and record matching?
For example: on Incident forms, the priority lookup rules sample data automatically sets the incident Data lookup and re

- What is a CI (configuration item)?
A CI may be: 
•	A physical entity, such as a computer or router 
•	A logical entity, such as an instance of a database 
•	Conceptual, such as a Requisition Service 


- How do you enable/disable an application in SNOW?
How to enable or disable an application?
Navigate to the “Application Menus” module under the system definition application. Open the respective application that requires enabling or disable. Set active as true to enable it or set active to false to disable it


- What does it mean to impersonate a user?
Impersonating a user means that you can log in to the system as that user and can have felt how the service-now UI is set for that user. This is very useful while testing. For example, if you are required to test that a user can access the change form or not. You can impersonate that user and can test instead of logging out from your session and logging in again with that user's credentials.

- What are script includes?

- Difference between Data Policy and UI Policy?
UI policy acts when a record is inserted or updated through a ServiceNow UI i.e ServiceNow forms while 
data policy acts whenever a record is inserted or updated into the database through any means.


- What is the difference between async and after Business Rules?

When business rules run
Business rules run based on two sets of criteria:
•	The time that the business rule is configured to run relative to a record being modified or accessed.
•	The database operation that the system takes on the record.
The following options are provided to determine the time the business rule should run:
Time the business rule should run
Option	When the rule runs
Before	After the user submits the form but before any action is taken on the record in the database.
After	After the user submits the form and after any action is taken on the record in the database.
Async	When the scheduler runs the scheduled job created from the business rule. The system creates a scheduled job from the business rule after the user submits the form and after any action is taken on the record in the database.
Note: Newly created business rules will run during upgrades.
Display	Before the form is presented to the user, just after the data is read from the database.
Note: Asynchronous business rules do not have access to the previous version of a record. Therefore, the changes(), changesTo(), and changesFrom()GlideElement methods do not work with async rule script.
 However, the condition builder and condition field (advanced view) both support the changes(), changesTo(), and changesFrom() methods.
The following options are provided to determine the database operation that the system takes on the record:
Database operation that the system takes on the record
Option	When the rule runs
Insert	When the user creates a new record and the system inserts it into the database.
Update	When the user modifies an existing record.
Query	Before a query for a record or list of records is sent to the database. Typically you should use query for before business rules.
Delete	When the user deletes a record.


- What is diff betw choice list and choice action?
A choice list is a type of field that lets the user select from a pre-defined set of choices. Administrators can define the available choices and customize the behavior and appearance of choice lists.
The Choice [sys_choice] table stores the values that appear in choice lists.
    To view the values in the Choice table, right-click the field label and select Personalize > Show Choice List.

1.	Transform Maps.
2.	In the Field Maps related list, select one of the following actions from the Choice action field:
o	create – creates a new reference field record if a matching record does not exist.
o	ignore – ignores new records in the reference field and completes processing of all other fields in the transform map.
o	reject – stops the transform for the entire record.
Note: The field map only displays the Choice action field for reference fields.


- What are data dictionaries?
The data dictionary defines every table and field in the system. It contains information about a field’s data type, default value, dependency, and other attributes.

- What does coalesce mean?
Coalesce is a property of a field that we use in transform map field mapping. 
When we set the coalesce as true for a field mapping it signifies that this field will work as a unique key. 
If a field match is found with the coalesce field, then the existing record will be updated with the imported information in the target table else a new record will be inserted into the target table


- What are UI policies?
UI policies are alternatives to client scripts. 
It can be used to set a field as mandatory, read-only, and visible on a form. 
You can also use UI policy for dynamically changing a field on a form.


- What is a data policy?
Data policy checks the mandatory and read-only of a field whenever a record is inserted or updated through a web service or import set.

- What is a client script?
Client script sits on the client-side(the browser) and run there only.
types of client script are OnLoad() OnSubmit() OnChange() OncellEdit)

- What is a business rule? 
- Global Business Rules also allow creation of reusable JavaScript. 
They can impact performance because they are loaded on every interaction between a user and the platform. 
Script Includes load only on demand and do not impact performance.

Business rule
Business Rules are server-side logic that execute when database records are queried, updated, inserted, or deleted. Business Rules respond to database interactions regardless of access method: for example, users interacting with records through forms or lists, web services, or data imports (configurable). Business Rules do not monitor forms or form fields but do execute their logic when forms interact with the database such as when a record is saved, updated

- How do you call it from client script?
A business rule is server-side scripting that executes whenever a record is inserted, updated, deleted, displayed, or queried. 
The key thing to keep in mind while creating a business rule is that when and on what action it has to execute. You can run the business rule ‘on display, ‘on before’, or ‘on after’ of an action (insert, delete, update) is performed.
Yes you can call a business rule through a client script by using glideajax


- What is the Task table?
Task is core base table , extends, parent of incident, problem, change
Task [task] is one of the core tables provided with the base system.
It provides a series of standard fields used on each of the tables that extend it, such as the Incident [incident] and Problem [problem] tables. In addition, any table which extends task can take advantage of task-specific functionality for driving tasks.
The Planned Task plugin provides the Planned Task [planned_task] table, which extends the Task [task] Table to provide more fields for tasks to measure duration and effort.

- What is a UI macro?
-   How do you use it?
UI macros are discrete scripted components administrators can add to the user interface.
UI macros are typically controls that provide inputs or information not provided by existing field types. By default, the system provides UI macros for a variety of user interface elements such as:
•	All formatters
•	The Service Catalog cart
•	The action icons next to fields
•	The action icons on forms and lists
•	The widgets of a content management system
•	The Orchestration activity designer
Administrators can create their own UI macros to provide custom controls or interfaces. Creating UI macros requires knowledge of Jelly script. Review the existing UI macros for examples and suggested approaches. Those who want to build custom interfaces with JavaScript technologies should consider Service Portal as an alternative.
Calling UI macros
Administrators can call UI macros from certain record types associated with the user interface.

- What is a glide record?
Gliderecord is a java class that is used for database operations instead of writing SQL Queries.

- What is diff betw client script and catalog client script?
Catalog client scripts are very similar to standard client scripts, with a few important differences.
•	Instead of selecting a table such as Incident for the script, select a catalog item or variable set. As your system may have a large number of catalog items, you should select a catalog item or variable set using a reference field instead of the choice list that the standard Client Script form uses.
•	When using an onChange() catalog client script, it is linked to a particular variable instead of a field. The system automatically populates the variable name selection list with any named variables from the catalog item or variable set selected.


- What is diff betw global business rule and script include?

Global Business Rules also allow creation of reusable JavaScript. 
They can impact performance because they are loaded on every interaction between a user and the platform. 
Script Includes load only on demand and do not impact performance.

Business rule
Business Rules are server-side logic that execute when database records are queried, updated, inserted, or deleted. Business Rules respond to database interactions regardless of access method: for example, users interacting with records through forms or lists, web services, or data imports (configurable). Business Rules do not monitor forms or form fields but do execute their logic when forms interact with the database such as when a record is saved, updated

- What is ACL?
	What is ACL?

An ACL is an access control list that defines what data a user can access and how they can access it in service now.
What is table.none?
What is table.*?
What is table.field?
An ACL is an access control list that defines what data a user can access and how they can access it in service now.
	If you define a READ ACL with Table.None for Admin & ITIL
Result: Both Admin and ITIL will be able to view all records because they have access to all record with no field restrictions.
	If you define a READ ACL with Table.None for Admin & ITIL & Table.* for Admin
Result: Only Admin will have read access because the Table.* is an explicit rule at the field level that grants only Admin read access to all fields.
	If you define a READ ACL with Table.None for Admin & Table.* for ITIL
Result: ITIL will not be able to view any records because they only have access at the field level and not at the Record/Row level.
	To grant read access to fields 1-10 for Admin and only Fields 1-9 for ITIL:
Table.None read Access Control granted to Admin and ITIL
Table.Field10 read Access Control granted to only Admin
	To grant read access to fields 1-10 for Admin and only Fields 9-10 for ITIL:
Table.None read Access Control granted to Admin and ITIL
Table.* read Access Control granted to only Admin
Table.Field9 read Access Control granted to only ITIL
Table.Field10 read Access Control granted to only ITIL


What is table.none?
	‘Table.None’ applies to the whole table including records. (Green Color)

What is table.*?
	‘table.*’ applies to every field on a record without a table.field rule (Purple Color)
Search order for field level rule

What is table.field?
	‘table.field’ applies to only one field on a record. (Red Color)


24.	How to create new tables/columns?

Procedure
1.	Navigate to System Definition > Tables.
2.	Click New and complete the form
3.	In the Columns section, use the Table Columns embedded list to add columns to the table
4.	In the Controls section, define additional table options
5.	In the Application Access section, define the scope protection for the table. For more information, see Application access settings
1.	Click Submit.
What to do next
To change the field labels in your table or the label of the table itself, perform the following task:
1.	Navigate to the Field Label [sys_documentation] table, and filter the table to show the table that has the fields you want to change. To find the label that represents the table itself, filter the records where Element is empty.
2.	Open the field record that you want to change, and make your updates. For a description of each field, see Field Label table.
Global default fields
When you create a new custom table, several fields appear in the Table Columns embedded list. For all tables, required system fields are added automatically. You cannot delete or modify these fields.

25.	What is diff betw parent / base table / core table / extended table?
Parent- extendable
Base  - no parent, task cmdb
True base tables are those that can be extended so you may want to filter on the "Extensible" field where value is true
Core- out of box, incident, task, ets
Extended ( child extended from parent)

A table is a collection of records in the database. Each record corresponds to a row in a table, and each field on a record corresponds to a column on that table.
Applications use tables and records to manage data and processes, such as Incident, Problem, and CMDB. Tables can extend other tables, creating parent tables and 

- What is an update set? 
- 26.	What is an update set? How do you merge/validate them?

An updated set is a group of customization.
 It captures the customization or configuration changes made by a user and then these update sets can be moved from one instance to another.
 For example, if we made some configuration changes in our development environment and want some changes in our test environment then we can capture all the changes in an updated set and can move this update set to the test environment instead of doing changes manually in a test environment.

27.	What is service catalog?
With the ServiceNow® Service Catalog application, create service catalogs that provide your customers with self-service opportunities. Customize portals where your customers can request catalog items such as service and product offerings.
 You can also standardize request fulfillment to ensure the accuracy and availability of the items in the catalogs.
28.	What is diff betw service request and request item?

Request can have 1 or more items.
29.	What is diff betw task table and sc_task table?
Task table
Service catalog task
The TASK table is the generic table that many of the other tables in ServiceNow extend from. Incident, problem, change, request, request item, catalog task (sc_task), and others all extend from the task table. The task table has the more generic fields like short description, description, assignment group, and assigned to that are used across a lot of the other tables. If you report on the task table you'll get records from all of the extended tables.
What is variable set?
Administrators and catalog administrators often 
define multiple catalog items that use the same group of service catalog variables. 
Catalog managers and catalog editors can 
attach a variable set for items and categories to which they are assigned. However, catalog managers and catalog editors cannot create a variable set.

- What is the diff betw before insert and after insert in business rule?
After user clicks submit, before  record inserted
After submit, after inserted

- What is diff betw onload and onchange client scripts?
Onchange- field vale changed
Unlike onLoad() and onSubmit() scripts, 
onChange() scripts apply to a particular widget on a form rather than to the form itself. 
They are fired when a particular value changes on-screen.
An onChange() script must contain a function named onChange().

onLoad() Scripts
An onLoad() script runs when a form is first drawn and before control is given to the user to begin typing. Typically, you use an onLoad() script to perform some client side manipulation of the document on screen.
An onLoad() script must contain a function named onLoad(). Otherwise, it is entirely up to you what your script does after it gets to the client.


- What does ServiceNow recommend to use - client script or UI policy? Which is better/ more efficient?
ui policy if you can

- What is UI action?
- UI Actions
UI actions add buttons, links, and context menu items on forms and lists, making the UI more interactive, customizable, and specific to user activities. UI actions can contain scripts that define custom functionality.
Administrators and users with the ui_action_admin role can define UI actions.
UI Action Controls:
	 A button on a form
	 A context menu item on a form (appears when you right-click the form header)
	 A related link in a form
	 A button in the banner on top of a list
	 A button at the bottom of a list
	 A context menu item on a list (appears when you right-click the list)
	 An menu item for the action choice list at the bottom of a list
	 A related link at the bottom of a list

- What is Script Include?
Store JavaScript for execution on the server
Each script include defines either an object class or a function
Must be called to run
Reusable (Write Once Use Many)
Only loaded on Request
Can be Client callable
Note: Global Business Rules also allow creation of reusable JavaScript. They can impact performance because they are loaded on every interaction between a user and the platform. 
Script Includes load only on demand and do not impact performance.
To access script includes, navigate to System Definitions > Script Includes. 
Script includes have a name, description and script. They also specify whether they are active or not, and whether they can be called from a Client Script.


- What is Server side and Client Side Script?
-  Server side scripting : 
Web servers are used to execute server side scripting. They are basically used to create dynamic pages. It can also access the file system residing at web server. Server-side environment that runs on a scripting language is a web-server. 
Scripts can be written in any of a number of server-side scripting language available. It is used to retrieve and generate content for dynamic pages. It is used to require to download plugins. In this load times are generally faster than client-side scripting. When you need to store and retrieve information a database will be used to contain data. It can use huge resources of server. It reduces client-side computation overhead. Server sends pages to request of user/client. 
1. Client side scripting : 
web browsers execute client side scripting. It is use when browsers has all code. Source code used to transfer from web server to user’s computer over internet and run directly on browsers. It is also used for validations and functionality for user events. 
It allows for more interactivity. It usually performs several actions without going to user. It cannot be basically used to connect to databases on web server. These scripts cannot access file system that resides at web browser. Pages are altered on basis of users choice. It can also used to create “cookies” that store data on user’s computer. 


- What is diff betw client script and catalog client script?

Catalog client scripts are very similar to standard client scripts, with a few important differences.
•	Instead of selecting a table such as Incident for the script, select a catalog item or variable set. As your system may have a large number of catalog items, you should select a catalog item or variable set using a reference field instead of the choice list that the standard Client Script form uses.
•	When using an onChange() catalog client script, it is linked to a particular variable instead of a field. The system automatically populates the variable name selection list with any named variables from the catalog item or variable set selected.

- Difference between GlideAJAX and GlideRecord?
GlideAjax
has both a client-side, and a server-side component to it.
 In this section, I will do my best to explain it as clearly as possible. 
For starters, GlideAjax is not just a replacement for the GlideRecord API. However, it can replace that functionality (and more) on the client, by asking the server to do most of the work. In this way, GlideAjax can be a massive boon to your client-side performance, if used correctly and where appropriate. 
What GlideAjax is, is essentially just a way to construct an AJAX call which triggers a client-callable Script Include on the ServiceNow servers, which then returns some value(s) back to the client. I say "value(s)", because the response is actually XML, and can contain multiple values, so you're not locked down to just returning one static value. 

Glide record
The .addQuery() method of the GlideRecord class can accept various types of arguments. As we mentioned above, a single argument will be treated like an encoded query. Two arguments will be treated as an equivalency test (that is, the first argument being the field, and the second argument being the value to which the field is compared for equivalency). Specifying three arguments however, allows you to do more granular queries. For example


- What is the difference between g_form.setdisplay and g_form.setvisible?
Both methods are used to hide the fields on the form.
However setDisplay() will reclaim the space if the field is hidden.

In any case it is always recommend to use UI policy wherever possible to make the fields hide/read/mandatory on the form.
 In circumstance where your req doesn't suffice then go with the client scripts.

both methods cannot hide mandatory fields with no value and the only difference i found is,
setDisplay()
If the field is hidden, the space is used to display other items. that means below field like, if sub status of the incident is not displaying then assignment group will display on that blank space.
setVisible()
If the field is hidden, the space is left blank.you can see the change on the form clearly.


But it is not suggestible to use these methods, instead of this just go for UI policies.


- Difference between Asset and CI?
An asset is an item, entity, or thing (tangible or intangible) that holds value for a Company or a person. 
Examples of Assets are Estates, Resources, Inventory, Equipment and Valuables. 
Note: All CI’s is not an asset, but all Asset’s is a CI

- Asset Management vs CMDB 
Note: Asset Management and Configuration Management Database are related to each other but have different goals. 
- Asset management focuses on the financial tracking of the company property. 
- Configuration Management focused on building and maintaining elements that creates an available network of services. 

- What is Flow Designer?
Flow Designer is a Now Platform® feature for 
automating processes in a single design environment.
 Flow Designer lets process owners use natural language to automate approvals, tasks, notifications, and record operations without coding.
You can expand Flow Designer to communicate with external instances and third-party systems by requesting a separate subscription to IntegrationHub.

1.	Automating process
2.	Use natural language
3.	Automate approvals, tasks, email notifications and table operations
4.	Integrate with external systems

- Discovery integration with MID Server?
The Management, Instrumentation, and Discovery (MID) Server is a Java application that runs as a Windows service or UNIX daemon on a server in your local network. The ServiceNow® MID Server enables communication and the movement of data between a ServiceNow instance and external applications, data sources, and services.

The MID Server initiates all communications with the ServiceNow® instance. This communication is recorded as records in the ECC Queue, which acts as the communication log between the instance and the MID Server. The MID Server picks up any work it has to do from the ECC Queue and returns the results of that work to the queue.


- Different steps involved in LDAP integration?
LDAP is the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. It is used for user data population and User authentication. Servicenow integrates with LDAP directory to streamline the user login process and to automate the creation of user and assigning them roles
There are 7 major steps to complete LDAP Integration:
	Load X.509 Certificate for SSL
	Create Server 
	LDAP Configuration 
	OU Definitions 
	Define Data source 
	Define Transform map 
	Create a Schedule 


- SOAP and REST Webservices?
Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is an XML-based protocol for accessing web services over HTTP.
REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is a simple stateless architecture that provides standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for them to communicate with each other.

Web services
HTTP-based web services allow diverse applications to talk to each other. 
ServiceNow supports both 
inbound (provider) and 
outbound (consumer) web services.

Outbound web services
Outbound web services allow you to send SOAP and REST messages
 to external web service providers.
Inbound web services allow you to access and modify ServiceNow data using a client application.

- Integration Hub using a Flow Designer?
Automate integration tasks using ServiceNow components for Flow Designer, or develop custom integrations. A separate subscription is required.
Capabilities
Integration Hub enables execution of third-party APIs as a part of a flow when a specific event occurs in ServiceNow. 
These integrations, referred to as spokes, 
are easy to configure and enable you to quickly add powerful actions without the need to write a script.
 For example, you can post a message and incident details in a Slack channel when a high priority incident is created.
Integration Hub provides the following functionality:
Spokes for base system integrations
Using Integration Hub actions in Flow Designer, you can:
•	Post messages and ServiceNow incident, problem, and change record details to Slack spoke, or Microsoft Teams spoke communications channels.
•	Synchronize data across multiple production instances using Integration Hub Remote Process Sync.
Create custom integrations
Build custom integrations with Action Designer using a REST step or a Script step.
Automate the administration of servers and applications in your network
Use custom actions to delegate Flow Designer processes to a MID Server in your network. For example, actions that use the PowerShell step or REST step.


- Asset Management (Entire Life Cycle)?
ServiceNow includes default States and Substates that meet the needs of most customers:
 - On Order – the asset has been ordered but has not yet been received. 
- In Stock – the asset is in Stockroom. Its Substates indicate whether an in-stock asset is available to be deployed or not.
 - In Transit – the asset is being transferred from one location to another (ex: between stockrooms). - In Use – a non-consumable is being used; the asset is typically managed as a Configuration Item as this state.
 - Consumed – a consumable is being used.
 - In Maintenance - the asset is being maintained. 
- Retired – indicates end of life.
 - Missing – the asset cannot be located after the appropriate level of Investigation has been performed
The consumable lifecycle stages are as follows.
•	On order
•	In stock
•	In transit
•	Consumed
•	In maintenance
•	Retired
•	Missing


- Process and Data Flows in Domain Seperation?
Data flows from bottom to top (top has access to all)
Process flow from top to bottom 

- Difference betweeen Override and Dictionary Override?
Dictionary Overrides provides the capability to override several properties of a field in an extended table.
 For example, a changing table is extended from the task table. There is a field named status in the task table and set as read-only. When we use this field in change form it will show be read-only. We can set this to non-read only by using the dictionary override. Similarly, there are other properties that can be set for the fields in an extended table. 
 
 override- a subdomain can override an sla from parent by editing, they get there own copy, and do not have 2 slas for the same thing

- Difference between SLA, OLA and Underpinning Contract?
SLA Stands for Service Level Agreement – Signed between the Customer/Client and the Service Provider
OLA Stands for Operational Level Agreement – Signed between Business Units/Divisions and Internal IT of the same Organization
UC Stands for Underpinning Contracts – Signed between Service Provider and the Vendor

- What is Automated Tested Framework and what it is used for?
The Automated Test Framework (ATF) enables you to create and run automated tests to confirm that your instance works after making a change. For example, after an upgrade, during application development, or when deploying instance configurations with update sets. Review failed test results to identify the changes that caused the failure and the changes that you should review.

- What are Views in Forms?
 The view defines the arrangement of fields on a form or a list. For one single form, we can define multiple views according to the user preferences or requirements.

- What is Form Section?
How can you cancel a form submission through client script?
In the onSubmit function return false. function onSubmit() { return false;}          

How to set a field unique on the table
Go to that respective field dictionary and set the unique check box to true.



# ***Service Portal***
## What is diff betw Service Portal and CMS system?
Service Portal is a compelling alternative to the Content Management System (CMS) with a refined user experience.
 It does not duplicate CMS or platform UI functionality. Users who have sophisticated experiences delivered through CMS may need to invest time into transitioning to Service Portal, especially if the CMS implementation includes complex and customized Service Catalog forms.
Service Portal compatibility with existing CMS sites
ServiceNow continues to support CMS in current and upcoming releases. If you have existing CMS sites and activate Service Portal on your instance, your CMS sites will continue to work, as CMS and Service Portal are separate applications.
Differences between Service Portal and CMS
Service Portal is an alternative to CMS based on more modern technologies. Major differences include:
Underlying technology
CMS uses Jelly, which is not a widely used technology. 
Service Portal instead uses AngularJS, server-side JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Any scripts that use Jelly do not work in Service Portal. Building widgets in Service Portal requires knowledge of AngularJS.
Visual layer
CMS uses iFrames which can be difficult to work with, limited in terms of styling, and susceptible to upgrade issues.
 Alternatively, Service Portal is a self-contained application that accesses data from other tables on the platform. This enables fine-tuned control over style and responsive design.
Mobile first
Unlike CMS, Service Portal is optimized for a mobile environment. For this reason, the following apply to the Service Portal environment:
•	Any scripts used in Service Portal can only use APIs supported in a mobile environment. For example, some APIs used in your Service Catalog client scripts may not be supported. For a list of supported APIs, see Service Portal and client scripts.
•	Service Portal forms support a maximum of two-columns. As a result, any highly customized Service Catalog forms, such as catalog items and record producers that use containers and variable sets, must be simplified to work in a two-column layout.
If transitioning to Service Portal, review the following resource: Mobile client GlideForm (g form) scripting and migration.

## Can we domain separate Service Portal pages?
NO.

## What are the basic components of a service portal?
You should have a basic understanding of all the following components that make up a portal:
•	Themes: Themes define the look and feel of the whole portal, but can be overridden by other style configurations.
•	Pages: Pages control where and how you store portal content. Pages do not have a defined relationship to portal records, they simply exist.
•	Widgets: Components in Service Portal are called widgets. You can use HTML templates, CSS, client scripts, server scripts, and any JavaScript dependencies to define what a widget does. From an AngularJS standpoint, widgets are essentially a superset of an Angular directive.
•	Most of the data in Service Portal is managed in different locations throughout the system.
For example, if you are building a knowledge portal, the data exists in Service Portal, but the knowledge articles are authored and managed in the Knowledge application. The same is true for any other type of content you plan to leverage. Take time to understand which tables contain and control the data you are working with in Service Portal.

## What is a widget and what are its components?
Widgets include both mandatory and optional components.
HTML Template
The widget's HTML accepts and displays data.
•	Renders the dynamic view a user sees in the browser using information from the model and controller
•	Binds client script variables to markup
•	Gathers data from user inputs like input text, radio buttons, and check boxes
HTML is mandatory.
Client Script
The widget's Client Script defines the AngularJS controller.
•	Service Portal maps server data from JavaScript and JSON objects to client objects
•	Processes data for rendering
•	Passes data to the HTML template
•	Passes user input and data to the server for processing
A Client Script is mandatory.
Server Script
The widget's Server Script works with record data, web services, and any other data available in ServiceNow server-side scripts.
•	Sets the initial widget state
•	Sends data to the widget's Client Script using the data object
•	Runs server-side queries
A Server Script is mandatory.
Link Function
The Link Function uses AngularJS to directly manipulate the DOM.
A Link Function is optional.
Option Schema
The Option Schema allows a Service Portal Admin (sp_admin role) to configure a widget.
•	Specifies widget parameters
•	Allows admin users to define instance options for a widget instance
•	Makes widgets flexible and reusable
An Option Schema is optional.
Angular Providers
An Angular Provider:
•	Keeps widgets in sync when changing records or filters
•	Shares context between widgets
•	Maintains and persists state
•	Creates reusable behaviors and UI components then injects them into multiple widgets
Angular Providers are optional.

## What are pages?
Use pages to organize content, ensure responsive mobile optimization, and design meaningful portal user experiences for your customers. A page houses containers and rows, which then contain widgets. By manipulating the layout of the page, and the widgets within it, you can construct your desired user experience.
•	Pages are referenced using the page ID.
•	Pages can be referenced in more than one portal.
•	Use base system pages as templates.
Containers
Containers are markup artifacts that are put on a page to contain the layouts that house the widgets.
You can view containers and how they make up a page in the Service Portal Designer (Service Portal > Service Portal Configuration > Designer). 

## How to secure service portal page?
Control user access to a portal.
Control who accesses your portal and what they can see in the following ways:
•	Authentication: Configure login and single sign on for users
•	Limit page access by role: Use roles to limit the users who can see a page.
•	Public pages: Use the public check box on a page record to make the page publicly accessible.
Note: A number of portal pages that are installed by default are marked public. Filter your list of Service Portal pages for Public [is] true to identify these pages. Setting the Public value to false will prevent these pages from being publicly available.
•	User criteria: For a more advanced way of limiting user access, create and apply user criteria to pages, widgets, widgets instances, and search sources.
•	Multifactor authentication: If an instance is configured to require multifactor authentication, users are automatically directed to set up multifactor authentication upon initial login. For setup instructions, see Setup multi-factor authentication upon initial login. If multifactor authentication is optional, users can still enable or disable authentication from their user profile. For setup instructions, see Setup multi-factor authentication on your user profile.
Single sign-on, logins, and URL redirects
Service Portal uses a combination of system properties and script includes to determine how the system handles URL redirects for users logging in to the portal.
Configure page security by role
Set up pages to be public or filter them by role.
Configure widget security
Configure widget security to ensure that your widget is being accessed only by the intended audience.
User criteria for Service Portal
User criteria enables you to allow access to users based on role, department, group, location, or company. Administrators can control access to pages, widgets, widget instances, announcements, and search sources in a portal by creating and applying user criteria.
Enable e-signature for Service Portal
You can configure e-signature in Service Portal to require re-authentication from approving users.
Enable external user self-registration for Service Portal
Enable external users to register to a ServiceNow app through Service Portal.
Register your PIV/CAC card for Service Portal login
Register your Personal Identity Verification (PIV) or Common Access Card (CAC) card so that you can log in to your organization's portal without entering a password.

## What are features not supported in Service Portal?
Domain separation

# ***JAVASCRIPT***
## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. 
With the HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.

## What is the DOM? How to manipulate the DOM?
The HTML DOM (Document Object Model)
When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.
The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects:

With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:
•	JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
•	JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
•	JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
•	JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
•	JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
•	JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
•	JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page
________________________________________________________________________________


The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.
The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:
"The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."
The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:
•	Core DOM - standard model for all document types
•	XML DOM - standard model for XML documents
•	HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents
________________________________________
What is the HTML DOM?
The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:
•	The HTML elements as objects
•	The properties of all HTML elements
•	The methods to access all HTML elements
•	The events for all HTML elements
In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.

HTML DOM methods are actions you can perform (on HTML Elements).
HTML DOM properties are values (of HTML Elements) that you can set or change.
The getElementById Method
The most common way to access an HTML element is to use the id of the element.
In the example above the getElementById method used id="demo" to find the element.
________________________________________
The innerHTML Property
The easiest way to get the content of an element is by using the innerHTML property.
The innerHTML property is useful for getting or replacing the content of HTML elements.
The innerHTML property can be used to get or change any HTML element, including <html> and <body>.


## What are the JavaScript data types?
## What are the data types in JS?
The set of types in the JavaScript language consists of primitive values and objects.
•	Primitive values (immutable datum represented directly at the lowest level of the language)
o	Boolean type
o	Null type
o	Undefined type
o	Number type
o	BigInt type
o	String type
o	Symbol type
•	Objects (collections of properties)


## What is the use of isNaN function?
In JavaScript NaN is short for "Not-a-Number".
The isNaN() method returns true if a value is NaN.
The isNaN() method converts the value to a number before testing it.

## What is an undefined value in JavaScript?
## What are undeclared and undefined variables?
Undeclared − It occurs when a variable which hasn’t been declared using var, let or const is being tried to access.

Undefined − It occurs when a variable has been declared using var, let or const but isn’t given a value.


## How can you add new elements dynamically?
The document.createElement() creates a new HTML element.
The document.createTextNode() creates a text node.
The appendChild() method appends dynamic element to body or target element.
The document.querySelector() allows to select desired element using any valid selector.

## How can you use functions / different types of functions?
Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

## What is hoisting?
JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.
Hoisting allows functions to be safely used in code before they are declared.
Variable and class declarations are also hoisted, so they too can be referenced before they are declared. Note that doing so can lead to unexpected errors, and is not generally recommended.

## What are the new features of ES6?
Let
Const
For…of
Template literals
Default values for function parameters
Arrow functions
Ciasses
Modules
Rest parameter
Spread operator
Destructuring assignment


## What are the scopes in JS?
Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope.
ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: 
let and const.
These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.
Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:

Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope.
Variables declared inside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block.
Local Scope
Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.
Local variables have Function Scope:
They can only be accessed from within the function.
JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope.
Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.
Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared inside a function.
They all have Function Scope:


## What are global variables? How are these variable declared and what are the problems associated with using them?


Global JavaScript Variables
A variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL.
A global variable has Global Scope:
All scripts and functions on a web page can access it. 

Global Scope
Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.
Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.
Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.
They all have Global Scope:

## Explain the working of timers in JavaScript? Also discuss the drawbacks of using the timer, if any?
Timers are used to execute a piece of code at a set time or also to repeat the code in a given interval of time. This is done by using the functions setTimeout, setInterval and clearInterval.
The setTimeout(function, delay) function is used to start a timer that calls a particular function after the mentioned delay. The setInterval(function, delay) function is used to repeatedly execute the given function in the mentioned delay and only halts when cancelled. The clearInterval(id) function instructs the timer to stop.
Timers are operated within a single thread, and thus events might queue up, waiting to be executed.
The setTimeout() and setInterval() are both methods of the HTML DOM Window object.

## What is === operator? Compare with == operator?
=== equal value and type
== equal value / may not be same type

## What is type coercion?
Type coercion is the process of converting value from one type to another (such as string to number, object to boolean, and so on). Any type, be it primitive or an object, is a valid subject for type coercion. To recall, primitives are: number, string, boolean, null, undefined + Symbol (added in ES6).

## Explain how can you submit a form using JavaScript?

Set the name attribute of your form to "theForm" 
JavaScript provides the form object that contains the submit() method. Use the ‘id’ of the form to get the form object.
For example, if the name of your form is ‘myform’, the JavaScript code for the submit call is:
document.forms["myform"].submit();
But, how to identify a form? Give an id attribute in the form tag
Here is the code to submit a form when a hyperlink is clicked:
<form name="myform" action="handle-data.php">
Search: <input type='text' name='query' />
<a href="javascript: submitform()">Search</a>
</form>
<script type="text/javascript">
function submitform()
{
  document.myform.submit();
}
</script>




## What are some common JavaScript events?
An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.
Here are some examples of HTML events:
•	An HTML web page has finished loading
•	An HTML input field was changed
•	An HTML button was clicked


## Can we add more than one "document.ready()" function in a page?
You can have multiple ones, but it's not always the neatest thing to do. Try not to overuse them, as it will seriously affect readability. Other than that , it's perfectly legal. See the below:
http://www.learningjquery.com/2006/09/multiple-document-ready


## What are the four parameters used for jQuery.ajax method?
The ajax() method is used to perform an AJAX (asynchronous HTTP) request.
All jQuery AJAX methods use the ajax() method. This method is mostly used for requests where the other methods cannot be used.
Parameter values
This method can have several name/value pairs for the AJAX requests. The names and values are defined in the following table.
Async
beforeSend
cache
complete
url
...

## What is Ajax?
AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.
AJAX is not a programming language.
AJAX just uses a combination of:
•	A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
•	JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)


## What are the advantages of Ajax?
•	Allows applications to render without data and fill data as the application gets it from the server.
•	Gives platform independence to application developers
•	Faster page renders
•	More responsive applications
•	No rerenders of whole pages are needed to update only a single area.


•	Update a web page without reloading the page
•	Request data from a server - after the page has loaded
•	Receive data from a server - after the page has loaded
•	Send data to a server - in the background


## What are the disadvantages of Ajax?
•	Any user whose browser does not support JavaScript or XMLHttpRequest, or has this functionality disabled, will not be able to properly use pages that depend on Ajax.
•	Multiple server requests need more data consumed at the client-side.
•	Failure of any one request can fail the load of the whole page.
•	Browsers with JS disabled will not be able to use pages using ajax.


## What are all the controls of Ajax?

The keystone of AJAX is the XMLHttpRequest object.

The important properties of the XMLHttpRequest object are given below.
o	onReadyStateChange - It is called whenever readystate attribute changes.
o	readyState - It represents the state of the request.
o	responseText - It returns response as text.
o	responseXML - It returns response as XML.
o	status - It returns the status number of a request.
o	statusText - It returns the details of status.

 important methods of XMLHttpRequest?
o	abort() - It is used to cancel the current request.
o	getAllResponseHeaders() - It returns the header details.
o	getResponseHeader() - It returns the specific header details.
o	open() - It is used to open the request.
o	send() - It is used to send the request.
o	setRequestHeader() - It adds request header.


## What are all the technologies (ie. think: protocol) used by Ajax?
HTML/XHTML and CSS - These technologies are used for displaying content and style.
DOM - It is used for dynamic display and interaction with data.
XML - It is used for carrying data to and from server
XMLHttpRequest - It is used for asynchronous communication between client and server.
JavaScript - It is used mainly for client-side validation

## What is JSON?
Javascript object notation
 it is language and platform independent.
 is a syntax for exchanging and storing the data. It is language independent data format and an open standard file format. It is mainly based on the Javascript
•	Data is in name/value pairs
•	Data is separated by comma
•	Curly brackets hold objects
•	Square bracket holds arrays

# ***ANGULARJS***
Note: We did not learn AngularJS which is different from Angular.
I am currently learning AngularJS at https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-angularjs

The answers are from various sources/ will update.

## What is AngularJS? 
AngularJS is an open-source JavaScript framework used to build rich and extensible web applications. It is developed by Google and follows the MVC (Model View Controller) pattern. It supports HTML as the template language and enables the developers to create extended HTML tags which will help to represent the application's content more clearly. It is easy to update and receive information from an HTML document. It also helps in writing a proper maintainable architecture which can be tested at a client-side.

## How is it different from Angular 2+?
AngularJS is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web framework. It doesn't support the features of a server-side programming language, nor dynamic loading of the page.
Angular is a complete rewrite of AngularJS. 
AngularJS was completely based on controllers and scopes whereas, Angular uses component hierarchy as its main architecture!

Angular uses the TypeScript language, which has features like :
Static Typing
Object-Oriented Programming based on classes
Support for reactive programming using RxJS

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12488769/148313384-be126011-ea0c-4f8a-8e63-306a36df18a9.png)


## What is scope in AngularJS?
-A $scope is an object that represents the application model for an Angular application.
Each AngularJS application can have only one root scope but can have multiple child scopes.


## What are directives? Mention some of the most commonly used directives in AngularJS application.
- Directives are the markers on DOM element which are used to specify behavior on that DOM element. All AngularJS directives start with the word "ng". There are many in-built directives in AngularJS such as "ng-app", "ng-init", "ng-model", "ng-bind", "ng-repeat" etc.
###	ng-app
The ng-app directive is the most important directive for Angular applications. It is used to locate the beginning of an Angular application for AngularJS HTML compiler. It marks the HTML elements that Angular intends to make the root element of the application. The custom attributes use spinal-cases, whereas the corresponding directives follow the camelCase. If we do not use this directive and try to process other directives, it gives an error.
###	ng-init
The ng-init directive is useful for initializing the data variable's inline statement of an AngularJS application. Therefore, those statements can be used in the specified blocks where we can declare them. A directive ng-init is like a local member of the ng-app directive, and it may be a single value or a group of the values. It directly supports JSON data.
###	ng-model
The ng-model directive binds the values of HTML elements such as input, select, textarea to the application data. It provides two-way binding behavior with the model value. Sometimes, it is also used for databinding.
###	ng-bind
The ng-bind directive is used to bind the model/variable's value to HTML controls of an AngularJS application. It can also be used with HTML tags attributes like: <p/>, <span/> and more but it does not support two-way binding. We can only check the output of the model values.
###	ng-repeat
The ng-repeat directive is used to repeat HTML statements. It works the same as for each loop in C#, Java or PHP on a specific collection item like an array.


## What is injector?
An injector is referred to as a service locator. It is used to receive object instances as defined by the providers, invoke methods, instantiate types, and load modules. Each Angular application consists of a single injector which helps to look upon an instance by its name.

## What is the difference between link and compile in Angular.js?
Link is used for combining the directives with a scope and producing a live view. The link function is used for registering DOM listeners as well as updating the DOM. The linking function is executed as soon as the template is cloned.
There are two types of linking function:
### Pre linking function
Pre-linking functions are executed before the child elements are linked. This method is not considered as a safe way for DOM transformation.
### 	Post linking function
Post-linking functions are executed after the child elements are linked. This method is a safe way for DOM transformation


## What are the styling form that ngModel adds to CSS classes ?
The ng-model directive binds the values of HTML elements such as input, select, textarea to the application data. It provides two-way binding behavior with the model value. Sometimes, it is also used for databinding.

## Explain what is DI (Dependency Injection ) and how an object or function can get a hold of its dependencies?
Dependency Injection- It specifies a design pattern in which components are given their dependencies instead of hard-coding them within the component.

## Benefits of AngularJS?
Some of the main advantages of AngularJS are given below:
o	Allows us to create a single page application.
o	Follows MVC design pattern.
o	Predefined form validations.
o	Supports animations.
o	Open-source.
o	Cross-browser compliant.
o	Supports two-way data binding.
o	Its code is unit testable.


## Explain the MVC design pattern
AngularJS is based on MVC framework, where MVC stands for Model-View-Controller. MVCperforms the following operations:
o	A model is the lowest level of the pattern responsible for maintaining data.
o	A controller is responsible for a view that contains the logic to manipulate that data. It is basically a software code which is used for taking control of the interactions between the Model and View.
o	A view is the HTML which is responsible for displaying the data.
For example, a $scope can be defined as a model, whereas the functions written in angular controller modifies the $scope and HTML displays the value of scope variable.


## What is the DOM?
AngularJS is a JavaScript framework with key features like models, two-way binding, directives, routing, dependency injections, unit tests, etc. On the other hand, JQuery is a JavaScript library used for DOM manipulation with no two-way binding features.
o	Directive- It specifies behavior on the DOM element.
Directives are the markers on DOM element which are used to specify behavior on that DOM element. All AngularJS directives start with the word "ng". There are many in-built directives in AngularJS such as "ng-app", "ng-init", "ng-model", "ng-bind", "ng-repeat" etc.


## How to traverse/manipulate the DOM? Where in AngularJS do we do this?

Compiler is an AngularJS service which traverses the DOM looking for attributes. The compilation process happens in two phases.

Compile: traverse the DOM and collect all of the directives. The result is a linking function.

Link: combine the directives with a scope and produce a live view. Any changes in the scope model are reflected in the view, and any user interactions with the view are reflected in the scope model. This makes the scope model the single source of truth.

Some directives such as ng-repeat clone DOM elements once for each item in a collection. Having a compile and link phase improves performance since the cloned template only needs to be compiled once, and then linked once for each clone instance.
https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/compiler#!

## What is scope?
A $scope is an object that represents the application model for an Angular application.
Each AngularJS application can have only one root scope but can have multiple child scopes. 
Some of the key characteristics of the $scope object are given below:
o	It provides observers to check for all the model changes.
o	It provides the ability to propagate model changes through the application as well as outside the system to other associated components.
o	Scopes can be nested in a way that they can isolate functionality and model properties.
o	It provides an execution environment in which expressions are evaluated.


## What are directives? Can you name some?
AngularJS provides support for creating custom directives for the following type of elements:
o	Element Directive
Element directives are activated when a matching element is encountered.
o	Attribute
Attribute directives are activated when a matching attribute is encountered.
o	CSS
CSS directives are activated when a matching CSS style is encountered.
o	Comment
Comment directives are activated when a matching comment is encountered.

## What is the injector?
An injector is referred to as a service locator. It is used to receive object instances as defined by the providers, invoke methods, instantiate types, and load modules. Each Angular application consists of a single injector which helps to look upon an instance by its name.

## What is the diff betw link and compile?

Angular's HTML compiler allows us to teach the browser, new HTML syntax. It also allows the developer to attach new behavior or attributes to any HTML element known as directives. AngularJS compilation process automatically takes place in the web browser. It does not contain any server-side or pre-compilation procedure.
AngularJS uses <$compiler> service for the compilation process of an Angular HTML page. Its compilation process starts after the HTML page (static DOM) is completely loaded.

It occurs in two phases:
o	Compile
It checks into the entire DOM and collects all of the directives.
o	Link
It connects the directives with a scope and produces a live view.
The concept of compile and link has been added from C language. The code is compiled and then linked.

## What is dependency injection?
Dependency Injection (also called DI) is one of the best features of AngularJS. It is a software design pattern where objects are passed as dependencies rather than hard coding them within the component. It is useful for removing hard-coded dependencies and making dependencies configurable. To retrieve the required elements of the application that need to be configured when the module is loaded, the "config" operation uses Dependency Injection. It allows separating the concerns of different components in an application and provides a way to inject the dependent component into the client component. By using Dependency Injection, we can make components maintainable, reusable, and testable.

## What does ngModel do?
The ng-model directive binds the values of HTML elements such as input, select, textarea to the application data. It provides two-way binding behavior with the model value. Sometimes, it is also used for databinding.

## What are pipes?
A filter is used to format the value of the expression to display the formatted output. AngularJS allows us to write our own filter. Filters can be added to expressions by using the pipe character |, followed by a filter.

## What does ngRepeat do?
The ng-repeat directive is used to repeat HTML statements. It works the same as for each loop in C#, Java or PHP on a specific collection item like an array.

## ngIf?
The ngIf directive removes or recreates a portion of the DOM tree based on an {expression}. If the expression assigned to ngIf evaluates to a false value then the element is removed from the DOM, otherwise a clone of the element is reinserted into the DOM.

ngIf differs from ngShow and ngHide in that ngIf completely removes and recreates the element in the DOM rather than changing its visibility via the display css property. A common case when this difference is significant is when using css selectors that rely on an element's position within the DOM, such as the :first-child or :last-child pseudo-classes.

Note that when an element is removed using ngIf its scope is destroyed and a new scope is created when the element is restored. The scope created within ngIf inherits from its parent scope using prototypal inheritance. An important implication of this is if ngModel is used within ngIf to bind to a javascript primitive defined in the parent scope. In this case any modifications made to the variable within the child scope will override (hide) the value in the parent scope.

Also, ngIf recreates elements using their compiled state. An example of this behavior is if an element's class attribute is directly modified after it's compiled, using something like jQuery's .addClass() method, and the element is later removed. When ngIf recreates the element the added class will be lost because the original compiled state is used to regenerate the element.

Additionally, you can provide animations via the ngAnimate module to animate the enter and leave effects.

## What is ngclick?
The ngClick directive allows you to specify custom behavior when an element is clicked.

## What are expressions?
Expressions in AngularJS are the code snippets that resolve to a value. AngularJS expressions are placed inside {{expression}}. Expressions are included in the HTML elements.
AngularJS expressions can also contain various valid expressions similar to JavaScript expressions. We can also use the operators between numbers, including strings, literals, objects, and arrays inside the expression {{ }}.

## What is a single page application? How to achieve this in AngularJS?
Routing is one of the main features of the AngularJS framework, which is useful for creating a single page application (also referred to as SPA) with multiple views. It routes the application to different pages without reloading the application. In Angular, the ngRoute module is used to implement Routing. The ngView, $routeProvider, $route, and $routeParams are the different components of the ngRoute module, which help for configuring and mapping URL to views.

## What is data binding? one-way / two-way? give the syntax?
Data Binding is the automatic synchronization of data between model and view.
In AngularJS, it performs the automatic synchronization process between the model and view.

## What is a module?
- It defines an application.

## What is bootstrapping? How do you bootstrap your application?
AngularJS will detect if it has been loaded into the browser more than once and only allow the first loaded script to be bootstrapped and will report a warning to the browser console for each of the subsequent scripts. This prevents strange results in applications, where otherwise multiple instances of AngularJS try to work on the DOM.
https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/function/angular.bootstrap#!

## What is a service?
 It stores and shares data across the application.
 
 Services are objects that can be used to store and share data across the application. AngularJS offers many built-in services, and each of them is responsible for a specific task. They are always used with the prefix $ symbol.
Some of the important services used in any AngularJS application are as follows:
o	$http- It is used to make an Ajax call to get the server data.
o	$window- It provides a reference to a DOM object.
o	$Location- It provides a reference to the browser location.
o	$timeout- It provides a reference to the window.set timeout function.
o	$Log- It is used for logging.
o	$sanitize- It is used to avoid script injections and display raw HTML in the page.
o	$Rootscope- It is used for scope hierarchy manipulation.
o	$Route- It is used to display browser-based path in browser's URL.
o	$Filter- It is used for providing filter access.
o	$resource- It is used to work with Restful API.
o	$document- It is used to access the window.Document object.
o	$exceptionHandler- It is used for handling exceptions.
o	$q- It provides a promise object.
o	$cookies- It is used for reading, writing, and deleting the browser's cookies.
o	$parse- It is used to convert an AngularJS expression into a function.
o	$cacheFactory- It is used to evaluate the specified expression when the user changes the input.


## What is a provider?
AngularJS provides the following core components which can be injected into each other as dependencies:
o	Value
o	Factory
o	Service
o	Provider
o	Constant

## How to make an AJAX call in AngularJS?
Angular provides two different APIs to handle Ajax requests. They are
•	$resource
•	$http

## What is interpolation?
Interpolation markup with embedded expressions is used by AngularJS to provide data-binding to text nodes and attribute values.

An example of interpolation is shown below:

<a ng-href="img/{{username}}.jpg">Hello {{username}}!</a>
https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/interpolation#!
